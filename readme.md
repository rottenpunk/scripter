# Scripter

This is a c like scripting language compiler that I wrote 20 years ago.  I used it for a customer project.  
I am currently in the process of reviving it so I can use it in various embedded projects. 

This system is divided into two parts, a compiler that spits out a pcode object file, and a runtime environment which can execute
the pcode program.


More to come!
